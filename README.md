# Herpes---Comp-Bio-Python-Pipeline-Project
Hi, welcome to a walkthrough through our 2025 Computational Biology Python Pipeline Project.

This project revolves around the human Herpesvirus 5, which is also known as the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). 

Throughout this project, we will be using the HCMV transcriptomes of 2 patient donors: 2 transcriptomes each (one consisting from 2 days post infection, and the other from 6 days post infection) - so a total of 4 transcriptomes!
